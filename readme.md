This project included some subprojects. All of them are combined in a multi-project structure. 
You can run each separately by choosing your select run/debug configuration menu.

                                ***Attention*** 
There isn't a standard project with a acceptable structure. I have written it in a simple form for 
having less dependency on the different types of knowledge. Each concept is implemented separately 
and is implementable with any level of programming knowledge.
